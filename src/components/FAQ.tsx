      question: "How does SautiAI collect debts differently than traditional methods?",
      answer: "SautiAI uses advanced AI to have natural, human-like conversations with debtors via voice calls, WhatsApp, and SMS. Our AI understands context, shows empathy, and negotiates payment plans automatically - recovering 65% more debts than traditional methods."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the AI can't resolve a debt?",
      answer: "If our AI reaches an impasse, the case is automatically escalated to your human team with full conversation history and suggested next steps. You maintain full control while the AI handles the majority of routine collections."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I see results?",
      answer: "Most clients see their first successful collections within 24-48 hours of setup. Our AI works 24/7, so it's constantly engaging with debtors across different time zones and schedules."
    },
    {
      question: "Is SautiAI compliant with debt collection regulations?",
      answer: "Absolutely. SautiAI is fully compliant with FDCPA, TCPA, and other relevant regulations. Our AI is trained on current compliance requirements and automatically follows all legal guidelines for debt collection communications."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize how the AI communicates with my debtors?",
      answer: "Yes! You can customize the AI's tone, communication style, payment options, and escalation triggers. The AI learns from your preferences and successful collection strategies to improve over time."
    },
    {
      question: "What integrations are available?",
      answer: "SautiAI integrates with popular CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero), and payment processors (Stripe, PayPal). We also offer a robust API for custom integrations."
